# About Project

This project is a Sales Performance Dashboard developed in Microsoft Excel using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Timelines, and Maps. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how raw business data can be converted into valuable insights for better decision-making.

The dataset contains information about Salespersons, Customers, Products, Categories, States, and Time periods. Using this dataset, multiple pivot tables and charts were created to analyze sales performance from different perspectives. To make the analysis more interactive, Slicers and Timelines were applied, enabling users to filter and compare results dynamically.

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of business performance through key metrics such as Total Sales, Units Sold, and Unique Customers. It also highlights Top Salespersons, State-wise Sales Distribution, Product Category Contribution, and Monthly Sales Trends. A map chart was included to visualize the geographical spread of sales across different states of India.

This project can be useful for managers, analysts, and students who want to practice data visualization, reporting, and dashboard building in Excel. It represents a practical approach to understanding how organizations track performance and take strategic decisions.
